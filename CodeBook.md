Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the Y and Z axis. 

The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Transformations
The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
