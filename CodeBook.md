Subject: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
Activity: Each row identifies the activity performed for each window sample. i.e. Laying, Sitting, Standing or Walking. 
tBodyAcc (mean or standard deviation): Each row shows the mean or standard deviation of the body measure.
tGravityAcc (mean or standard deviation): Each row shows the mean or standard deviation of the gravity measure.

Note:
1.The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the Y and Z axis. 
2.The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Data Transformations
The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
