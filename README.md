===================================

The run_analysis.R script is made up of a list of functions that make up the follwoing tasks:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

They are connected with variables to allow passing for each dataset.

See CodeBook.md for more information on the variables, the data, and the transformations that takes place.
